# Data Science Portfolio

Hello, Welcome to my Portfolio ðŸ™‚

In this repository, you will find a compilation of my projects and case studies on various topics which I have learned through my masters course. I have gained good hands-on experience on Python, relevant data science python libraries, database design through these projects and case studies.

### [Case Study: Low Resource Language Translation using Neural Machine Translation](https://github.com/PrathyushaBajanthri/DataScience_Portfolio/tree/work-in-progress/deep_learning/low_resource_language_translation)

This case study concentrates on NLP topics: `Low Resource Language Translation` exploring `Domain Adaptation`. The main goal of the project is to develop a Neural Machine Translation model `(transformer)` which can translate text from a High Resource Language to Low Resource Language. This model is also trained with medical domain data using a finetuning technique called domain adaptation. The transformer model is implemented using a `PyTorch` based framework `JoeyNMT`, text pre-processing using sacremoses, indic-nlp-library and subword-nmt libraries. This project has many experiments to train the model from source to target language and viceversa. A critical analysis of models perfomance in various stages of development is presented.

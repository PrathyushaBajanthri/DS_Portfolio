#Naughts_and_Crosses_MiniMax

The goal of this Python3 project is to implement a simple AI that plays noughts and crosses (also known as tic-tac-toe) using the minimax algorithm. Ultimately it should print out a game where both players play perfectly; it should be a draw.

In the Jupyter notebook,  I have provided a detailed description of the MiniMax algorithm and python functions.
